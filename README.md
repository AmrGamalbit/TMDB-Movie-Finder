**The Movie Finder App** is essential for movie lovers. It allows users to search for movies and view detailed information, including release dates, ratings, overviews, cast, and more. The app helps users find the most engaging movies for their next weekend!

The app relies on scraping data from TMDB's official website based on the user's input and displays the information in a clean, tidy graphical interface.

This app has been built using Python and its modules. It demonstrates how web scraping can automate complex tasks and save valuable time.
### Features 
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly enter and find movies youâ€™re looking for.
- **Detailed Movie Info:** Access essential movie details such as release date, overview, cast, and an elegant quote from the movie.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Simple and clean interface for easy navigation.

> This project provided me with a great opportunity to learn professional features of desktop applications and explore the amazing field of web scraping.

Walking through the project, I plan to add functionality for searching TV shows and further enhance the interface. These features will be implemented as soon as possible.
